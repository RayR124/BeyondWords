app concept:
OK, so the company [Beyond Words] would allow users to sign up for a monthly subscription wherein we would allow them to type up and save in our database various messages to loved ones. In our database, users could create a list of people, with linked mailing addresses for each, and a specific message designated to that person. Then, at the time of their death, when their membership to our app is cancelled, their letters to all their addressees would be sent out in physical form. Allowing them to send parting words to whomever they have designated. Offering words of wisdom to their kids whom they will never see again. Letters of final thoughts of love and farewells to spouses. Even letters of hate or respite to rivals. All from beyond the grave. The service would be cheap, maybe a dollar per person listed per month, and could have a premium membership which would allow for bigger/longer letters, more designates, and optional add on services such as flowers delivered with the letters, etc. What's best, is we could bundle this idea with various insurance carriers which we could then prorate the fees into so the user would never even see a bill from us, it would be included in a bill they're already paying.
